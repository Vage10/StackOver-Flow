## Features

* MERN Stack Overflow Clone with MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS (MERN) stack.
* Backend powered by Node.js and Express.js for efficient server-side processing.
* MongoDB, a NoSQL database, handles data storage for user-generated content.
* Frontend uses React.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
* React Hooks manage state and lifecycle events, enhancing code readability and reusability.
* Axios is employed for making API requests for communication between frontend and backend.
* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is utilized to handle cross-origin requests securely.
* Redux and Redux-Thunk manage application state and enable asynchronous actions.
* Context and RESTful API principles used for global state management and standardized data manipulation.
* Features include user registration and authentication, asking and answering questions, upvoting and downvoting answers, commenting, searching for questions, and more.
* The clone offers an intuitive user interface and powerful functionalities for both beginners and advanced users.

## Technologies Used
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for persistent data storage.
* ExpressJS: A backend framework facilitating the creation of scalable and modular RESTful APIs.
* ReactJS: Forms the core of the user interface, enabling dynamic and interactive components.
* Node.js: A server-side runtime environment for efficient handling of HTTP requests, database interactions, and business logic implementation.
* Axios: A popular HTTP client for making API requests.
* Redux: A state management library employed to handle global application state and provide a predictable and centralized data flow.
* Redux-Thunk: Middleware that enhances Redux functionality by enabling asynchronous actions for seamless integration with APIs and data fetching.
* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Employed to enable secure cross-domain communication for integration with external APIs and services.
* Context/RESTful API: Practices used for efficient data management and communication between components, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
